The objective of this assignment was to gather information from a json file and understand the information it contained. This was accomplished by importing the data via my terminal, creating a database, removing null data, adding missing records, and organizing the information into digestible dataframes and comparing different establishments. 

The biggest challenge for this exercise was importing the data via terminal, and I spent around an hour with ASK BCS (support) to get things working.
